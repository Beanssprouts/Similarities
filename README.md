# Similarities
The file you will run is called "**FinalProject.py**"This code checks the similarities between the writings of two pieces of work with source materials from two different authors and will tell the user whether the code was most likely written by author A or author B by analyzing the frequency of words used, length of sentences, etc.

The sources that are currently available in this file are the works of two related authors, John and Hank Green. These two are brothers and known to have somewhat similar styles of writing. The two sources come from an Article that Hank Green had written for the Newspaper Medium called “Can We Stop Complaining About the Trending Tab” and the book An Abundance of Katherines Written by John Green. The texts that I have chosen to compare to these sources are two passages from two different books written by John Green: Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, and two passages from two different books written by Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor and An Absolutely Remarkable Thing. I have also added an additional text: This is Not Tom which was a short novella written and displayed behind internet puzzles in the early 2000's. 

The result of my comparisons are as follows:

**A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor**

	The results for my text classification program works incredibly well. It had gotten both of the texts correct as to which author had written them. One thing that I would change about my code to improve upon is is most likely to clean up the look of the output of the program, as well as possibly clean up some of the code as well to make it more concise while still being able to get the code to work as it should. I would also like to add other features for the text to compare like punctuation, which had been taken out in the beginning, because some authors use punctuation as a way for them to express their emotions through a piece of text.
