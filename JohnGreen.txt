\'93So What are you good at, exactly, anyway? I mean, I know you\'92re good at everything, but what are you so good at besides languages?\'94 \'93I\'92m good with codes and stuff. And I\'92m good at, like, linguistic tricks like anagramming. That\'92s my favorite thing, really. I can anagram anything.\'94 \'93Anything?\'94 \'93Night, nay,\'94 he answered quickly, and she laughed and then said, \'93Katherine Carter.\'94 \'93Um, okay. Her karate cretin\'97um, oh. I like this one: their arcane trek.\'94 She laughed and pulled her hand away and placed it flat against his knee. Her fingers were soft. He could suddenly smell her over the dank basement. She smelled like lilacs, and then he knew that it was almost time. But he didn\'92t dare look at her, not yet. He just watched the blank TV screen. He wanted to draw out the moment before the moment\'97 because as good as kissing feels, nothing feels as good as the anticipation of it. \'93How do you do that?\'94 she asked. \'93Practice, mostly. I\'92ve been doing it a long time. I see the letters and pull out a good word first\'97like, karate, or arcane\'97and then I try to use the remaining letters to make \'97oh God, this is boring,\'94 he said, hoping it w a sn\'92t. \'93Okay, so anagrams. That\'92s one. Got any other charming talents?\'94 she asked, and now he felt confident. Finally, Colin turned to her, gathering in his gut the slim measure of courage available to him, and said, \'93Well, I\'92m a fair kisser.\'94 OTHER BOOKS YOU MAY ENJOY SPEAK Published by the Penguin Group Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 345 Hudson Street, New York, New York10014, U.S.A.

Very little, actually. Whenever I think about changing the past, it always begs the Back to the Future II question: If I could go into the past and share all kinds of important Life Lessons with my younger self, wouldn\'92t I become a radically different person, and then wouldn\'92t that person have to go back into the past to tell his young self all sorts of different pitfalls to avoid, and then doesn\'92t that create a paradox that makes my head hurt? At any rate, I wouldn\'92t want to tell my young self much, because I don\'92t want to be a radically different person. I want to be the exact same person I currently am, only with better tooth enamel. So I guess the honest answer to your question is that when I was growing up, I wish I had known that flossing is, as it turns out, actually important. How do your high school experiences shape your Writing? I attended a small and wonderful boarding school in Alabama called Indian Springs, and I\'92m certainly not above borrowing from my own high school experiences. I also think that my particular high school experience pushed me toward writing about 1. the South, and 2. smart kids, and 3. teenagers removed from direct parental control, and I also probably\'974.\'97owe this whole numbered-list-inside-a- sentence construction to high school, since I stole it from my friend Todd Cartee. Were you really dumped 53 times before you got married? The short answer is yes. But in the interest of full disclosure, there are a couple caveats to that statistic: 1. I have a rather narrow definition of getting dumped, which is this: Say you kiss someone once. Now, say you want to kiss them again, but they won\'92t let you, on account of how you\'92re just a great friend and she wouldn\'92t want to mess that up, or she\'92s not interested in a relationship right now, or she\'92s decided to pursue a relationship with a semi-professional bodybuilder, or she\'92s worried that if she starts making out with you a lot she won\'92t have time for the school newspaper, or she thinks you\'92re cute and everything but let\'92s be honest you would be disastrous for her social status, or whatever. If any of those things happen (and believe me, they have), you\'92ve been dumped. 2. There is widespread controversy over whether or not my wife (#53) technically dumped me. Sarah and I went out on two dates several years ago, after which she announced that she \'93wasn\'92t looking for a relationship right now.\'94 And then we didn\'92t go on a date for about eight months, which, as far as I\'92m concerned, constitutes dumping regardless of the fact that we later ended up getting married. Anagrams play a huge role in An Abundance of Katherines\'97Why? }
